# What are the steps in the design cycle

First step is planning 
Second step is proposing a solution
Third step is designing
Fourth step is developing
Fifth step is prototyping
Sixth step is evaluating

# What is the purpose of the success criteria?

The purpose of the success criteria is to measure just how successful or useful the product we created is for the client. We won't know how good it is without establishing the 
guidelines of how we want it to look in the end. 

# What do you understand now about computers/CS that you did not before Unit 1?

I now understand how much work and preparation it takes to develop a program or a product for someone and how important it is to follow the procedures of the design cycle. That CS 
isn't just about coding but it's also about understanding, preparing, and research. 

# What do you understand now about yourself that you did not before Unit 1?

That I can do computational thinking in a fast and concise way to solve a problem or make a solution for a program. I also have a lot of preserverance because i wanted to give up 
multiple times whenever i ran into a problem but i always powered through and found a solution. But when I did find a solution I felt extremely satisfied and proud of myself and
I really loved discovering that part of me.

# What worked well for you during the development of the unit 1

Coming up with ideas was easy since I had a lot of them and coming up with codes and solutions for the small parts was also easy and enjoyable for me. Integrating
the small sections of codes and seeing it together in one big program was enjoyable.

# What did not work for you during the development of the unit 1

Actually coding the rest of the game and having a solid, easy-to-follow plan for myself. Organization and time management was the part I struggled with the most. 

# A developer is responsible only for the accomplishment of the success criteria. Agree of disagree?

I disagree because just because you've reached the requirements of the success criteria doesn't mean it is a good or perfect project. There might be more requirements that 
come up after viewing the product and the developer should take responsibility to adapt to the changes and improve on the product. Things change and the developer should help
adapt it. The success criteria only shows the standards the developer created for themselves and won't be accurate for everyone. The success criteria may also be outdated for the 
times and the age it is operating in.
