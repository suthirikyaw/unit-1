### Question 1: Do you think it is necessary to involve the show owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer

I think it is necessary to be communicating with the shop owner at all phases of the three weeks of making their product. Whenever a major function is implemented or whenever I think I have met a criteria, it’s important to check with the owner to see if I really did in order to make sure we are on the same page about things because it’s easier to change the code immediately rather than at the end when things are already finished. It will make the program more prone to bugs and will also mean we will take longer to finish the product because we’ve already used the three weeks to make an unsatisfactory game. Addressing something immediately will make the process smooth and make it easier for the programmer to change it. 

### Question 2: Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?

I think it would be helpful to create MVPs for the game and start off with a basic storyline and basic controls. Then we can ask the client to review it and get feedback so we can implement more complicated and interesting features to the game so that the end product is not boring and satisfactory to the client. The client should give feedback about what they want us to add and what we could improve on so that we can code them before moving on.

### Question 3: Do you see similarities between the Human-Centered Design cycle presented in the video and the Design Cycle we use for developing software? Explain.

There are a lot of similarities between the two design cycles for example, the first stage of the Design cycle for software development is planning which is the same as idea generation where we have received an objective and are now thinking of ways to get there. Prototyping for designs and developing software is also similar because they are both creating a rough product of what the end might look like and getting feedback for it. They both also have a testing phase where before the final product is finished or revealed, they run tests to ensure its functionality and performance. 

### Question 4: What are the simple principles for human-centered design presented in the video? Write a sentence with the definition of each.

One of the principles is OBSERVATION where we watch and study what’s happening around us and how people interact with objects. From observing we get IDEA GENERATION where we think of proposals and solutions on how to fix problems that we notice people struggle with everyday. Then from all the ideation we are ready to turn all the ideas into reality by PROTOTYPING which is creating a rough product that isn’t perfect but overall shows what the final product will look like and fix anything that’s needed. Finally after building and creating, we get to TESTING which is to make sure the product does what it’s meant to do and the function of it is clear. Then we have the final product. 

### Question 5. Consider your game. Think about ways you can improve the Players’ Experience using Human-centered design. Write below your ideas:

Observe the best way to give out instructions of the game. Do people like tutorials that are straight to the point or tutorials within the game?
Get ideas from different types of people to have a diverse set of ideas
Make a simple game first then ask feedback to add more complicated things
Test the game every time I add ascii images to make sure they come out nicely
Test the game every time I add a decision making mechanic to see if it works properly
